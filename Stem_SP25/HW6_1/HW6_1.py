    This program solves for the unknown currents in the circuit of the homework assignment.
    Network 1:
        - Reads the resistor network configuration from "ResistorNetwork.txt".
        - Analyzes the circuit to solve for the unknown currents using Kirchhoff's laws.
    Network 2:
        - Reads the modified configuration from "ResistorNetwork_2.txt", which includes an additional
          5Î© resistor in parallel with the 32V source.
        - Uses a subclass (ResistorNetwork_2) to override circuit analysis methods (demonstrating polymorphism).

    The function prints the calculated currents for both networks.
